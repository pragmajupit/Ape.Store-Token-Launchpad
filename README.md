What is Ape.Store

Ape.Store is described as a launchpad that enables users to create (deploy) tokens in seconds—even if they don’t have deep technical knowledge.

After deployment, the token becomes instantly tradable on the platform, and liquidity is supposedly auto-handled (i.e., you don’t manually need to provide liquidity).

It provides “anti-rug” and “anti-honeypot” protection (as claimed on the listing at Coinbase Web3 apps directory).

Connect your crypto wallet to the Ape.Store site.

Ensure you have some ETH (or the appropriate network token) on the supported blockchain (e.g., Base network) to cover gas/fees.

Click “Deploy” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. After that the token is created and becomes tradable.

Optional: as the token creator you may choose to purchase some tokens of your own project via the deploy flow.

Important Considerations & Risks

Although the platform emphasises ease-of-use and speed, token launches remain high-risk: deploying a token instantly does not guarantee project success, legitimacy, or long-term liquidity.

The “anti-rug / anti-honeypot” claim is a feature, but you should still verify token contracts, ownership, liquidity lock, and community presence.

Using any crypto platform involves risks: gas fees, network risks, smart contract bugs, and potential for scams.

Make sure you understand on which network(s) Ape.Store operates (e.g., Base, Ethereum, etc) and the implications (wallet compatibility, bridging, etc).
